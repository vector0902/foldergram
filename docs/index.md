features:
  - icon: 🗂️
    title: Local-first
    details: Originals stay in your configured gallery root. Indexed metadata lives in SQLite and derivatives stay on disk next to the app's local storage paths.
  - icon: ⚡
    title: Fast feed-style browsing
    details: Runtime reads come from SQLite and generated derivatives instead of filesystem walks during every request.
  - icon: 🖼️
    title: Photos and videos
    details: Foldergram indexes supported image and video formats, generates thumbnails, creates previews eagerly or lazily, and can expose compatible original MP4 playback in the detail player.
  - icon: 🎯
    title: Honest scope
    details: The current app includes home feed browsing, a dedicated reels route, explore, library, likes and favorites, moments, optional admin/viewer/public access control, and admin-only maintenance controls without cloud sync or social features.

## Foldergram at a Glance

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min(420px, 100%), 1fr)); gap: 1rem; margin: 2rem 0;">

<div class="cs-feature">
<h3>🚀 What ships today</h3>
<p>The current repository includes Home, Reels, Explore, Library, Likes and Favorites, Moments, Settings, folder pages, a post detail view and modal flow, shared SQLite likes, browser-local favorites in public mode, delete actions, optional admin/viewer/public access control, and local scan/rebuild tooling.</p>
</div>

<div class="cs-feature">
<h3>🔍 How indexing behaves</h3>
<p>Foldergram recursively discovers non-hidden folders under <code>GALLERY_ROOT</code>. Any folder that directly contains supported media becomes an indexed album. Files placed directly in the gallery root are ignored.</p>
</div>

<div class="cs-feature">
<h3>💾 Formats and storage</h3>
<p>Foldergram indexes images like <code>.jpg</code>, <code>.png</code>, <code>.webp</code>, and <code>.gif</code>, plus videos like <code>.mp4</code>, <code>.mov</code>, <code>.m4v</code>, <code>.webm</code>, and <code>.mkv</code>. Originals stay in the gallery root, SQLite stores indexed metadata, thumbnails are written under <code>thumbnails/</code>, and previews under <code>previews/</code>.</p>
</div>

<div class="cs-feature">
<h3>🔐 Access modes</h3>
<p>Foldergram starts without a password gate by default. Settings can enable admin-only access, a separate viewer password, or anonymous public browsing. Once protection is enabled, only admins can open Settings or use Trash, scans, rebuilds, and delete actions.</p>

## How Foldergram Works

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min(280px, 100%), 1fr)); gap: 1rem; margin: 2rem 0;">

<div class="cs-feature">
<h3>1. Discover folders</h3>
<p>Walk the gallery tree, skip hidden paths, and ignore managed storage paths that would otherwise re-enter the scan.</p>
</div>

<div class="cs-feature">
<h3>2. Index posts</h3>
<p>Store normalized paths, media metadata, timestamps, stable sort order, and playback strategy in SQLite.</p>
</div>

<div class="cs-feature">
<h3>3. Generate derivatives</h3>
<p>Create `640px` thumbnails, up to `1500px` image previews, and 720p-class video previews. Derivatives can be generated during scans or lazily on first request.</p>
</div>

<div class="cs-feature">
<h3>4. Serve fast reads</h3>
<p>Feed, folders, likes, moments, and explore read from SQLite and derivative URLs instead of scanning the filesystem on request.</p>
</div>

<div class="cs-feature">
<h3>5. Build moments and highlights</h3>
<p>The home rail can surface date-based Moments when the library has enough EXIF-backed timestamps, or fall back to Highlights when capture-date coverage is sparse.</p>
</div>

<div class="cs-feature">
<h3>6. Maintain the library locally</h3>
<p>Admins can enable access protection and run manual scans, thumbnail rebuilds, and library-index rebuilds from Settings. If protection is still off, those controls are available immediately to whoever can reach the app.</p>
</div>
