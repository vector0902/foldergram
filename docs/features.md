# Features

This page documents what the current repository actually implements.

## Home

The home view is the primary feed surface.

It includes:

- three feed modes: Recent, Rediscover, and Random
- a top Moments or Highlights section
- feed-card avatar rings that can open an App Folder's avatar story in place when that folder has stories
- an active home-feed video player that promotes one visible video card at a time and gives that card play, mute, and fullscreen controls
- a startup scan state when the first index is still being built
- a rebuild notice when the configured gallery root changed
- desktop recommendations for folders based on recency, likes, and recent navigation
- infinite loading for feed pagination

### Feed mode behavior

| Mode | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Recent | "Newest posts first, with lighter runs from the same app folder." |
| Rediscover | "Older posts resurface when they are worth another look." |
| Random | "A fresh shuffle that stays steady while you browse." |

## Reels

The dedicated reels view is available at `/reels`.

It includes:

- a video-only queue sourced from indexed library posts
- a full-height scroll-snap deck
- wheel, arrow-key, and page-up/page-down navigation in addition to direct scrolling
- infinite loading with prefetch as you approach the end of the current queue
- a desktop action bar for like/favorite toggle, details sidebar, folder shortcut, and original-video link
- loading, empty, and error states
- an app-wide default mode from Settings; the page itself does not expose an inline mode switch

### Queue behavior

| Mode | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Recommended | "Affinity-ranked mix." It scores videos using freshness, likes, recent folder affinity, portrait fit, duration fit, and a deterministic seed, then reduces immediate repeats from the same folder when alternatives exist. |
| Recent | "Newest videos first." |
| Random | "Stable session shuffle." |

## Explore

Explore is a dedicated full-screen shell with a darker visual treatment.

It combines:

- a random feed source
- client-side ranking that boosts recent folder activity, liked folders, and recently opened folders
- folder search across name, slug, breadcrumb, and path
- local recent-search history stored in `localStorage`

Explore is a folder-search and serendipity surface, not a separate backend index.

## Library

Library lists every indexed folder and supports:

- free-text search
- sorting by recent activity, post count, name, or path
- quick navigation into folders
- delete actions from a context menu

### Folder deletion behavior

Library supports two delete flows:

| Flow | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Delete app folder | Deletes the folder's direct posts and their derivatives. Child app folders are kept. The source folder is only removed if it becomes empty. |
| Delete folder subtree | Removes the source folder subtree from disk, removes matching derivative subtrees, and deletes all affected indexed folders below that path. |

## Folder pages

A folder page is available at:

- `/folders/:slug`
- `/:slug` as an alias

Folder pages include:

- a folder header with avatar, posts counts, descriptions, and optional avatar-story opening
- editable folder name and description via an admin "Edit App Folder" flow
- a posts grid
- highlight circles above the posts and reels tabs when the folder has story capsules
- a reels tab when the folder contains videos
- infinite loading

The reels tab is a filtered view backed by the same folder endpoint using
`mediaType=video`.

## Folder stories and highlights

Foldergram can reserve `AppFolder/stories` as a story-style source for that
folder.

In the default reserved-stories mode:

- direct media inside `AppFolder/stories` becomes the folder's avatar story set
- each direct child folder inside `AppFolder/stories` becomes one highlight capsule
- nested folders below a highlight are folded into that same capsule instead of becoming separate app folders
- story media is hidden from normal folder, feed, search, and reels surfaces
- the folder header avatar opens the avatar story when one exists
- Home feed cards can open the same avatar story from the folder avatar ring
- the shared stories modal is used for both the home-feed entry point and the folder-page entry points

If the reserved root has no direct media but highlight capsules do exist,
Foldergram can synthesize the avatar story from recent highlight media so the
folder still has an avatar-story entry point.

## Post detail and modal flow

The post detail route is `/image/:id`.

Behavior depends on how the route is opened:

- from another page, it can render as a modal over the background route
- directly, it renders as a full page

The detail view includes:

- image detail media sourced from either generated previews or originals, depending on `IMAGE_DETAIL_SOURCE`
- video detail playback that defaults to the generated preview source
- an optional `HD` toggle for compatible higher-resolution MP4 originals
- previous and next navigation within the same folder and active media filter
- folder link and breadcrumb context
- size, dimensions, MIME type, and duration metadata
- like toggle
- original-file link
- an admin-only "Set as Cover" action to customize the folder avatar, which highlights dynamically if the image is already the cover
- delete action with confirmation for admin sessions only

## Likes and Favorites

Foldergram has two saved-items modes:

- signed-in `admin` and `viewer` sessions use shared SQLite likes through `GET /api/likes`
- anonymous public sessions use browser-local favorites stored in `localStorage`

The saved-items view:

- shows liked or favorited posts ordered by the most recent toggle in that mode
- updates optimistically in the UI
- drops deleted posts automatically when they are removed
- stays intentionally separate between shared likes and local favorites

There is no shared social layer behind either mode.

## Moments

Home and `/moments/:id` expose either:

- date-driven Moments
- fallback Highlights

The selected set depends on timestamp coverage in the current library. The UI
uses the same route name for both and adapts to the returned payload labels.

This is separate from folder stories and folder highlights sourced
from reserved `stories/` folders.

## Settings

Settings is the operational control surface for the library.

It exposes:

- admin-password controls
- viewer password and public access controls
- home and reels default feed-mode controls
- stories-folders mode controls, migration notices, and a save-and-rescan flow
- live scan status
- storage and index status
- last completed scan details
- manual scan
- thumbnail-only rebuild
- library-index rebuild

### Access protection

Settings can optionally enable role-based local access for the app.

That flow supports:

- turning the admin password on
- changing the admin password
- disabling protection again
- enabling or disabling a separate viewer password
- enabling anonymous public browse mode
- rotating the viewer password without knowing the current one
- signing the current browser session out

Current non-admin behavior:

- viewers can browse the library and use shared likes
- anonymous public visitors can browse immediately and use browser-local favorites
- `viewer` and `anonymous` sessions can elevate through `Unlock admin`
- non-admin sessions cannot open Settings
- non-admin sessions cannot use Trash, delete actions, scans, or rebuild actions

### Rebuild actions

| Action | What changes |
| --- | --- |
| Scan Library | Runs a normal scan against the current gallery root. |
| Regenerate Thumbnails | Clears generated thumbnails and video poster images, then rebuilds them from indexed media only. |
| Rebuild Library Index | Clears indexed folders, posts, likes, folder scan state, and scan history, then rescans the active gallery root and reuses matching cached derivatives when possible. In lazy derivative mode it does not pre-generate missing thumbnails or previews. |

## Theme and local UI preferences

The client also persists a few local browser preferences:

- light or dark theme
- whether videos start muted
- last opened folder
- recently opened folders
- recent explore searches

These are stored in `localStorage` and are not synced anywhere else.

## What is intentionally missing

The current repository does **not** implement:

- uploads from the UI
- comments
- messaging
- notifications
- multi-user accounts
- remote multi-user permissions
- cloud sync
- hierarchical album navigation
