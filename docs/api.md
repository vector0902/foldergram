# API

All documented routes come from `server/src/routes/api.ts`.

## Base paths

| Base path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/api` | JSON API |
| `/thumbnails` | Protected thumbnail derivatives, served from cache or generated on demand in lazy mode |
| `/previews` | Protected preview derivatives, served from cache or generated on demand in lazy mode |

## Authentication and protected routes

Foldergram can optionally require a role-bearing password session.

When password protection is enabled:

- most `/api` routes return `401` until the browser logs in, except for safe read routes in public viewer mode
- `GET /api/health`, `GET /api/auth/status`, `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/unlock-admin`, and `POST /api/auth/logout` stay reachable without an authenticated session
- `PUT /api/auth/password` is public only when password protection is currently disabled, so the first admin password can be set
- `/thumbnails/...` and `/previews/...` also require the same authenticated session unless public viewer mode is enabled
- authenticated sessions carry `admin` or `viewer` role data
- anonymous public reads use `role: "anonymous"` and `likesMode: "local"`
- admin-only mutations return `403` for viewer sessions

The frontend sends same-origin credentials automatically and uses a signed
cookie-based session.

## Mutation requirements

All mutating API routes are protected by `requireTrustedMutationRequest`.

### Required header

```http
x-foldergram-intent: 1
```

### Local-origin checks

For mutating requests:

- if `Origin` is present, it must be `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `::1`
- in development and test, the origin port must match `DEV_SERVER_PORT` or the reserved dev-client range from `DEV_CLIENT_PORT` through `DEV_CLIENT_PORT + 3`
- in production, loopback origins are allowed and same-host origins are allowed when they match the host serving the app on `SERVER_PORT`
- if `Origin` is absent but `Referer` is present, the same loopback check is applied to the referer origin

The shipped frontend adds `x-foldergram-intent: 1` automatically for `POST`,
`PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` requests.

## Common error behavior

| Status | When it happens |
| --- | --- |
| `401` | Password protection is enabled and the request is not authenticated. |
| `400` | Validation or request-shape errors surfaced through the Express error handler. |
| `403` | Missing intent header, failed local-origin check, or a viewer session hitting an admin-only route. |
| `404` | Missing folder, post, moment, or original media. |
| `409` | A scan or thumbnail rebuild was requested while the library requires a library-index rebuild after a gallery-root change. |

## Read endpoints

### `GET /api/health`

Returns process-level health plus storage state.

Example shape:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "timestamp": "2026-03-16T12:34:56.000Z",
  "storage": {
    "available": true,
    "reason": null,
    "usingInMemoryDatabase": false
  }
}
```

### `GET /api/auth/status`

Returns the current auth state for the browser session.

Example shape:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "authenticated": false,
  "role": "anonymous",
  "accessMode": "public",
  "likesMode": "local",
  "capabilities": {
    "canManageLibrary": false,
    "canDeleteMedia": false,
    "canAccessSettings": false,
    "canUseSharedLikes": false,
    "canUseLocalFavorites": true
  }
}
```

### `GET /api/feed`

Query parameters:

| Param | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `page` | integer | `1` | Minimum `1`. |
| `limit` | integer | `24` | Minimum `1`, maximum `60`. |
| `mode` | `recent | rediscover | random` | `random` | Home feed mode. |
| `seed` | integer | unset | Optional random seed for `random` mode. |

Response shape:

```json
{
  "mode": "recent",
  "items": [],
  "page": 1,
  "limit": 24,
  "total": 0,
  "hasMore": false
}
```

Notes:

- `items` contain both images and videos.
- `thumbnailUrl` points to `/thumbnails/...`.
- `previewUrl` points to `/previews/...`.

### `GET /api/reels`

Query parameters:

| Param | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `page` | integer | `1` | Minimum `1`. |
| `limit` | integer | `24` | Minimum `1`, maximum `60`. The current client helper requests `6` per page. |
| `mode` | `recommended | recent | random` | `recommended` | Reels queue mode. |
| `seed` | integer | unset | Optional seed used to keep `recommended` and `random` queues stable while paging. |
| `lastFolder` | string | unset | Optional recent-navigation hint used by `recommended`. |
| `recentFolders` | comma-separated string | unset | Optional recent-navigation hints used by `recommended`. |

Response shape:

```json
{
  "mode": "recommended",
  "items": [],
  "page": 1,
  "limit": 6,
  "total": 0,
  "hasMore": false
}
```

Notes:

- `items` contain videos only.
- `recommended` uses `lastFolder` and `recentFolders` to bias the queue toward folders you recently opened.
- `recent` ignores recommendation hints and returns newest indexed videos first.
- `random` and `recommended` stay stable across pages when the same `seed` is reused.

### `GET /api/feed/moments`

Returns the current Home Moments or Highlights definition.

The response can be:

- `moments`
- `highlights`

Response shape:

```json
{
  "railKind": "moments",
  "railTitle": "Moments",
  "railDescription": "Memory capsules shaped by real capture dates from your library.",
  "railSingularLabel": "Moment",
  "items": []
}
```

### `GET /api/feed/moments/:id`

Path parameters:

| Param | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | string |

Query parameters:

| Param | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `page` | integer | `1` |
| `limit` | integer | `24` |

Returns `404` with `{"message":"Feed capsule not found"}` when the ID does not
exist in the currently selected set.

### `GET /api/folders`

Returns:

```json
{
  "items": []
}
```

Each item is a folder summary with:

- `id`
- `slug`
- `name`
- `description`
- `folderPath`
- `breadcrumb`
- `imageCount`
- `videoCount`
- `latestImageMtimeMs`
- `hasAvatarStory`
- `avatarImageId`
- `avatarUrl`

### `GET /api/folders/:slug`

Returns one folder summary.

The response uses the same shape as folder items from `GET /api/folders`,
including `hasAvatarStory` so the client can decide whether the folder avatar
should open a story entry point.

Errors:

- `404` with `{"message":"Folder not found"}` if the slug is missing

### `GET /api/folders/:slug/images`

Query parameters:

| Param | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `page` | integer | `1` | Minimum `1`. |
| `limit` | integer | `24` | Minimum `1`, maximum `60`. |
| `mediaType` | `image | video` | unset | Optional folder filter. |

Response shape:

```json
{
  "folder": {
    "id": 1,
    "slug": "oslo",
    "name": "oslo",
    "description": null,
    "folderPath": "trips/oslo",
    "breadcrumb": "trips",
    "imageCount": 12,
    "videoCount": 3,
    "latestImageMtimeMs": 1700000000000,
    "hasAvatarStory": false,
    "avatarImageId": 42,
    "avatarUrl": "/thumbnails/trips/oslo/IMG_0001.webp?v=4"
  },
  "items": [],
  "page": 1,
  "limit": 24,
  "total": 12,
  "hasMore": false
}
```

Errors:

- `404` with `{"message":"Folder not found"}`

### `GET /api/folders/:slug/stories`

Returns the stories payload for one folder.

Response shape:

```json
{
  "railKind": "stories",
  "railTitle": "Stories",
  "railDescription": "Stories and highlights for AnimalPlanet.",
  "railSingularLabel": "Story",
  "hasAvatarStory": true,
  "avatarStoryId": "animalplanet-stories",
  "items": [],
  "highlights": []
}
```

Notes:

- `items` contains the avatar story first when one exists, followed by highlight capsules.
- `highlights` contains only highlight capsules.
- each capsule item includes `id`, `title`, `subtitle`, `dateContext`, `imageCount`, `coverImage`, and `presentation`
- `presentation` is `avatar` or `highlight`
- `avatarStoryId` can be a synthetic fallback id when the folder has highlight media but no direct avatar-story files

Errors:

- `404` with `{"message":"Folder not found"}`

### `GET /api/folders/:slug/stories/:id`

Path parameters:

| Param | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `slug` | string |
| `id` | string |

Query parameters:

| Param | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `page` | integer | `1` |
| `limit` | integer | `24` |

Response shape:

```json
{
  "railKind": "stories",
  "railTitle": "Stories",
  "railDescription": "Stories and highlights for AnimalPlanet.",
  "railSingularLabel": "Story",
  "story": {
    "id": "animalplanet-stories",
    "title": "AnimalPlanet",
    "subtitle": "AnimalPlanet story set",
    "dateContext": "Today",
    "imageCount": 8,
    "presentation": "avatar",
    "coverImage": {}
  },
  "items": [],
  "page": 1,
  "limit": 24,
  "total": 8,
  "hasMore": false
}
```

Notes:

- the paginated `items` array contains normal feed-item payloads
- if the requested avatar story is a fallback capsule, the server returns recent highlight media for that synthetic capsule

Errors:

- `404` with `{"message":"Story capsule not found"}`

### `GET /api/likes`

Returns:

```json
{
  "items": []
}
```

Items are ordered by like timestamp descending.

Notes:

- shared likes are available to `admin` and `viewer` sessions
- anonymous public sessions use browser-local favorites instead of this endpoint

### `GET /api/images/:id`

Query parameters:

| Param | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mediaType` | `image | video` | Optional filter used by the viewer when switching between posts and reels. |

Returns one post detail payload with:

- feed-item fields
- `relativePath`
- `mimeType`
- `fileSize`
- `originalUrl`
- `playbackStrategy` for videos when an original MP4 is browser-compatible
- `nextImageId`
- `previousImageId`

`nextImageId` and `previousImageId` are resolved within the same folder and the
same active `mediaType` filter when one is supplied.

Detail media rules:

- if `IMAGE_DETAIL_SOURCE=original` and the item is an image, `previewUrl` points to `/api/originals/:id`
- videos keep `previewUrl` on `/previews/...`
- compatible original MP4 videos can set `playbackStrategy: "original"` so the client can expose an optional original-quality switch

Errors:

- `404` with `{"message":"Post not found"}`

### `GET /api/originals/:id`

Serves the original file from disk by image ID only.

Rules:

- the indexed path must still exist
- the resolved path must stay within `GALLERY_ROOT`
- deleted posts do not resolve

Errors:

- `404` with `{"message":"Original media not found"}`

### `GET /api/status`

Returns viewer-safe operational state for the shell.

When access protection is enabled:

- `admin` and `viewer` sessions can always read it
- anonymous visitors can also read it when `viewer_access_mode=public`

Notable fields:

| Field | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `folders` | Active indexed folders. |
| `indexedImages` | Active indexed posts. The name is historical and still includes videos in the total feed count. |
| `indexedVideos` | Active indexed videos only. |
| `scan` | Live scan progress snapshot. `currentFolder` is redacted and `lastCompletedScan.error_text` is always `null`. |
| `storage` | Availability with a generic unavailable message only. |
| `libraryIndex` | Rebuild requirement plus ignored root-media count. Gallery-root paths are omitted. |
| `preferences.defaultHomeFeedMode` | Current app-wide default home feed mode. |
| `preferences.defaultReelsFeedMode` | Current app-wide default reels mode used when `/reels` opens. |
| `preferences.treatStoriesAsFolders` | Whether folders literally named `stories` are treated as ordinary app folders instead of reserved story sources. |
| `storiesMigration` | Migration hint with `hasLegacyStoriesCandidates` and `decisionPending`. |

### `GET /api/admin/stats`

Returns the full admin operational payload.

This route is read-only but `admin`-only. It extends `GET /api/status` with the
additional fields below:

| Field | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `deletedImages` | Soft-deleted post count. |
| `thumbnailCount` | Actual generated thumbnail files currently present on disk. |
| `previewCount` | Actual generated preview files currently present on disk. |
| `storage.usingInMemoryDatabase` | Whether SQLite had to fall back to in-memory mode. |
| `libraryIndex.currentGalleryRoot` | Current configured gallery root. |
| `libraryIndex.previousGalleryRoot` | Prior configured gallery root when the root changed. |
| `libraryIndex.lastSuccessfulGalleryRoot` | Gallery root from the last completed successful scan. |
| `lastScan` | Last completed scan run. |

The same `preferences.treatStoriesAsFolders` and `storiesMigration` fields from
`GET /api/status` are also present here.

## Mutating endpoints

### `POST /api/auth/login`

Body:

```json
{
  "password": "your-admin-or-viewer-password"
}
```

Success:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "auth": {
    "enabled": true,
    "authenticated": true,
    "role": "viewer",
    "accessMode": "password",
    "likesMode": "shared",
    "capabilities": {
      "canManageLibrary": false,
      "canDeleteMedia": false,
      "canAccessSettings": false,
      "canUseSharedLikes": true,
      "canUseLocalFavorites": false
    }
  }
}
```

Errors:

- `400` if password protection is not enabled
- `401` if the password is incorrect
- `403` when trust requirements are missing

### `POST /api/auth/unlock-admin`

Elevates the current browser into an admin session by verifying the admin
password.

This route stays reachable without an existing authenticated session so it can
be used from viewer mode and public mode.

Body:

```json
{
  "password": "your-admin-password"
}
```

Success:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "auth": {
    "enabled": true,
    "authenticated": true,
    "role": "admin",
    "accessMode": "public",
    "likesMode": "shared",
    "capabilities": {
      "canManageLibrary": true,
      "canDeleteMedia": true,
      "canAccessSettings": true,
      "canUseSharedLikes": true,
      "canUseLocalFavorites": false
    }
  }
}
```

Errors:

- `400` if password protection is not enabled
- `401` if the admin password is incorrect
- `403` when trust requirements are missing

### `POST /api/auth/logout`

Clears the current browser session cookie.

Success:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "auth": {
    "enabled": true,
    "authenticated": false
  }
}
```

### `PUT /api/auth/password`

Sets or changes the admin password.

Body when protection is disabled:

```json
{
  "password": "new-password"
}
```

Body when protection is already enabled:

```json
{
  "currentPassword": "old-password",
  "password": "new-password"
}
```

Notes:

- password minimum length is `8`
- `viewer` sessions receive `403`
- changing the password invalidates older sessions

### `DELETE /api/auth/password`

Disables password protection entirely.

Body:

```json
{
  "currentPassword": "current-password"
}
```

Errors:

- `400` if protection is already disabled
- `401` if the password is incorrect
- `403` if the current session is not `admin`

### `PUT /api/auth/viewer-access`

Configures viewer access mode.

Body for admin-only access:

```json
{
  "mode": "off"
}
```

Body for password-protected viewer access:

```json
{
  "mode": "password",
  "viewerPassword": "viewer-password"
}
```

Notes:

- `viewerPassword` is required when `mode=password`
- viewer and admin passwords must differ
- changing viewer access invalidates older sessions
- `mode=public` enables anonymous browsing immediately
- anonymous public sessions use local browser favorites instead of shared `/api/likes`

### `PUT /api/admin/settings/home-feed-default`

Sets the default mode used when Home opens.

Body:

```json
{
  "defaultMode": "recent"
}
```

Allowed values:

- `recent`
- `rediscover`
- `random`

Success:

```json
{
  "defaultMode": "recent"
}
```

### `PUT /api/admin/settings/reels-feed-default`

Sets the app-wide default mode used when `/reels` opens.

Body:

```json
{
  "defaultMode": "recommended"
}
```

Allowed values:

- `recommended`
- `recent`
- `random`

Success:

```json
{
  "defaultMode": "recommended"
}
```

### `PUT /api/admin/settings/stories-mode`

Sets how folders literally named `stories` are interpreted.

Body:

```json
{
  "treatStoriesAsFolders": false
}
```

Success:

```json
{
  "treatStoriesAsFolders": false
}
```

Notes:

- `false` enables the default reserved-stories mode
- `true` keeps `stories/` folders behaving like ordinary app folders
- the Settings UI immediately follows this write with `POST /api/admin/rescan`, but this endpoint itself only saves the setting

### `POST /api/images/:id/like`

Marks a post as liked.

Success:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "id": 42,
  "liked": true
}
```

Errors:

- `404` with `{"message":"Image not found"}` when the post does not exist or is deleted
- `403` when trust requirements are missing

### `DELETE /api/images/:id/like`

Removes a like.

Success:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "id": 42,
  "liked": false
}
```

### `DELETE /api/images/:id`

Permanently deletes:

- the source file from disk
- its thumbnail derivative
- its preview derivative

Then it updates the index and folder avatar state.

Success:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "id": 42,
  "folderSlug": "oslo"
}
```

Errors:

- `404` with `{"message":"Image not found"}`
- `403` for viewer sessions
- `403` when trust requirements are missing

### `DELETE /api/folders/:slug`

Query parameters:

| Param | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `deleteSourceFolder` | boolean | `false` | Accepts `true` or `false`. |

When `deleteSourceFolder=false`:

- direct posts in that folder are permanently deleted
- child folders below that path are kept
- Foldergram tries to remove now-empty directories

When `deleteSourceFolder=true`:

- the source folder subtree is removed from disk
- matching derivative subtrees are removed
- all indexed child folders under that subtree are removed

Success shape:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "slug": "oslo",
  "deletedImageCount": 12,
  "deletedFolderCount": 1,
  "deletedSourceFolder": false
}
```

Errors:

- `404` with `{"message":"Folder not found"}`
- `403` for viewer sessions
- `403` when trust requirements are missing

### `POST /api/admin/rescan`

Runs a manual scan against the current library and then starts the development
watcher.

Success:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "lastScan": {
    "id": 7,
    "status": "completed",
    "scanned_files": 120
  }
}
```

Errors:

- `409` with the library-rebuild-required message when the gallery root changed
- `403` for viewer sessions
- `500` for scan failures surfaced from the scanner

### `POST /api/admin/rebuild-index`

Stops the watcher, clears the indexed library tables, rescans the current
gallery root, and then restarts the watcher.

Matching cached derivatives already on disk are left in place and can be reused.
In `DERIVATIVE_MODE=lazy`, this rebuild does not pre-generate missing thumbnails
or previews.

This resets:

- `likes`
- `images`
- `folders`
- `folder_scan_state`
- `scan_runs`

### `POST /api/admin/rebuild-thumbnails`

Stops the watcher, clears the thumbnail cache, regenerates thumbnails and video
poster images from indexed media, and restarts the watcher.

It does **not** reset:

- previews
- likes
- folder records
- scan history

Errors:

- `409` with the library-rebuild-required message when a library-index rebuild is required
- `403` for viewer sessions

## Client helpers

The frontend wraps these endpoints in `client/src/api/gallery.ts`.

Those helpers are the best reference for current client-side usage, including:

- default page sizes
- when `mediaType` is sent
- which routes are expected to return `items` arrays versus single objects
